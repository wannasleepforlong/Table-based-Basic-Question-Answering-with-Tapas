# Table-based Basic Question-Answerer with Tapas
This project is a simple web application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload a CSV file containing tabular data, input a query related to the data, and receive an answer based on the query using the TAPAS (Table-based Pretraining and Answering System) model.

Features
- Upload CSV file: Users can upload a CSV file containing tabular data directly through the web interface.
- Input query: Users can input a question or query related to the data.
- Get answer: Upon submitting the query, the application uses the TAPAS model to extract the answer from the uploaded CSV data.
